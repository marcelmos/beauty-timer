Simple JavaScript app which allow you to set count down.

App just decrement specific values each 1 secound (1000ms).

>[Repaired] Not working adding new time without refresh.
>[Repaired] Decrement go faster if "Start" button get clicked many times.
>Buttons above and below each time section not working.
>Not insertinng values show "undefined"
