# About app
Simple JavaScript app which allow you to set count down.
App just decrement specific values each 1 secound (1000ms).
If secounds are equal zero minutes or houres become decremented.
Or timer just finished count down.

## App have many problems and bugs like:
>[Repaired] Not working adding new time without refresh.
>[Repaired] Decrement go faster if "Start" button get clicked many times.
>[Repaired] Buttons above and below each time section not working.
>[Repaired] Not insertinng values show "undefined"

## How run app
Just open index.html in your web browser.

## Future
In future I want to add "RESET" button for clear timer.
Adding visual effect when timer just end countdown.
